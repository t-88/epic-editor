# EpicEditor
epic editor is a bare bones game engine that uses onlt rectangles.             
[old version](https://github.com/t-88/ta6bi9y)   
    
the idea is that you create your game using the editor drag and drop / coding functionalities,when you finish your work you get to export it as a pygame project [epic.py api](https://github.com/t-88/epic.py).          
        
the base editor works and its filled with bugs,but there is a proof of concept pong game :).           
the export functionality is not implemented yet.         
     
# Quick Start
- its a simple html page i trust u can do it ;)

**it under development**


### Old readme (found it funny)  
web interface for app dev, chatgpt said its hard and i shouldnt do it, well not exally but i got the feeling about how to do it so fuck chatgpt i will do it.     
i think its like a vm where u generated file and let the vm do the magic, maybe when the file generated i will write a renderer in sdl or java or python, then u just drop the file in the vm and the magic happens i think.
