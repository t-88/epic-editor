# EpicEditor
epic editor is a bare bones game engine that uses onlt rectangles.             
[old version](https://github.com/t-88/ta6bi9y)   
    
the idea is that you create your game using the editor drag and drop / coding functionalities,when you finish your work you get to export it as a pygame project [epic.py api](https://github.com/t-88/epic.py).          
        
the base editor works and its filled with bugs,but there is a proof of concept pong game :).           
the export functionality is not implemented yet.
